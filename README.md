Results and Impact
The Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of an ensemble approach in classifying seven types of skin cancer using the HAM10000 dataset. The ensemble model, which combines ResNet-50, Inception, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, achieved high accuracy in predicting the correct type of skin lesion.

By providing high-accuracy, scalable, and interpretable predictions, this deep learning model has the potential to make a significant impact on the early detection of skin cancer, improving patient care and expanding diagnostic capabilities in dermatology.
